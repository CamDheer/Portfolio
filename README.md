The "dissertation" zip file contains my final year dissertation. This was a final year project which was A Quantitative Analysis 
of Image Segmentation techniques/algorithms using OCT Retinal images in the Search of highest accuracy to support the field of Ophthalmology.
The project aims to take OCT images and segement them using different segemntation algorithms to identofy different key aspects of the retina as this is currently a tedious process for humans. There is a current ground truth which has been annotated by a clinical expert. Once the image has been segmented by different algorithms which I have selected a dice score is produced which shows the similarity between a segmented image and the ground truth image. The higher the dice score the closer the segemnetation is to the one of the clinical expert thus being a better segemtation. This score is then shown as an excel file.
